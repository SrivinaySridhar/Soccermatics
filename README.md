# Srivinay Sridhar Football Analytics

## About Me

My name is Srivinay Sridhar. I am an IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications student. My passion for Sports led me to this degree (might seem suprising how far apart those two sound but in reality, it's integrating faster than ever) and now that I have gained the basic skills, I wanted to start my journey of exploring the field of Sports Analytics - specifically Football because that is the sport I have grown up playing and fallen in love with. 

## What am I doing here? 

Begin my journey in Football Analytics. I am pursuing the [Soccermatics course by David Sumpter](https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

I would like to thank the entire Soccermatics team for putting this wonderful course together and I hope to make the best out of the course. I have chosen to do this course as a Non-enrolled student. This [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T017WHJKU4C/C0412M72KA4) has many such students who are pursuing it in the same manner. They are working on the assignments, having peer reviews, setting up virtual meetings to discuss the major topics and posting their queries on this channel. David Sumpter is actively posting the problem statements for the assignments and is also reviewing the final submission of students.

## How did I end up here?

A week before starting my journey, I sent out connection invites on LinkedIn to many prominent professionals in the field of Football Analytics. I added personal invite messages in which I introduced myself, stated my passion to pursue Football Analytics and requested to connect with them hoping to be guided by them in the right path. I am thankful to professionals like Hadi Sotudeh, Edd Webster, and many more who accepted my invitation. They wished me luck, shared their words of wisdom and directed me to this wonderfully crafted course.
